BMI Calculator (Tkinter + Matplotlib)
This is a simple Python project that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using a GUI built with Tkinter. Users can enter their weight (kg) and height (m), calculate their BMI, and view the category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese). The data is saved in a CSV file, and users can visualize BMI trends through a graph plotted using Matplotlib. It's beginner-friendly and useful for learning GUI, file handling, and basic data visualization in Python.

Weather App (Python + OpenWeatherMap API)
This is a simple Python script that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed in the terminal. Just enter a city name, and the app shows a clean weather report. You need Python, the requests library, and a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code, run the script, and get live weather updates directly in your terminal.

Python Socket Chat (Server-Client)
This is a simple terminal-based chat application using Python's socket module, allowing two-way communication between a server and a client on localhost. The server waits for a client connection, and both can send messages to each other until either types bye to disconnect. To use it, run the script and enter server mode on one terminal and client on another. It's a basic example of socket programming for beginners learning networking in Python.

Random Password Generator (Python + Tkinter)
This is a simple GUI-based random password generator built using Python’s tkinter library. Users can specify the desired password length and choose to include letters, numbers, and symbols. The app generates a secure password accordingly and automatically copies it to the clipboard using the pyperclip module. It's beginner-friendly and a great way to learn about GUI, randomization, and basic input validation in Python.

Python Voice Assistant
This is a basic Python voice assistant that records your speech, converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition API, and responds using text-to-speech with gTTS. It can recognize simple commands like asking for the time or the assistant’s name. The assistant records audio, processes it, and responds verbally. Built with sounddevice, speech_recognition, and playsound, it's a great beginner project for learning speech recognition, audio handling, and voice interaction in Python.

Finance Tracker with GUI
This is a Python-based desktop application developed to help users manage their personal finances in a simple and effective way. It allows users to add daily income and expense transactions, which are stored in a CSV file and displayed in a user-friendly table. The application is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface, while Pandas and Matplotlib are used for data handling and visualization. Users can view a summary of their total income, total expenses, and the remaining balance, as well as a pie chart that visually compares income and expenses. The program also automatically creates the required data file (data.csv) on the first run, making it easy to use without any prior setup. This project was created by a first-year AI and Data Science engineering student as part of a hands-on learning experience in Python, focusing on GUI development, file handling, and basic data analysis.
